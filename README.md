# coolie
The digitization of historical texts invites researchers 
to explore the large-scale corpus of historical texts with computational methods.
In this study, we present computational text analysis on a relatively understudied topic of
how Asian workers are represented in historical newspapers in the United States. We found that the word "coolie" 
was semantically different in some States (e.g., Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Arkansas)
with the different discourses around coolie. We also found that then-Confederate newspapers and then-Union newspapers
formed distinctive discourses by measuring over-represented words. Newspapers from then-Confederate States
associated coolie with slavery-related words. In addition, we found Asians were perceived to be 
inferior to European immigrants and subjected to the target of racism. This study contributes to supplementing
the qualitative analysis of racism in the United States with quantitative discourse analysis.
